# **A Simple Bubble Generator**

This is just a simple side project for fun.

- 10 bubbles will be generated on the page and you will be able to hover them, which will stop the hovered bubble movement.
- If you click on a blank spot a new bubble will be generated

TODO  :
- On click on a bubble split into more bubbles
- On hover stop the bubble and make it draggable for the user
    - Stop is done
    - Make it draggable now
