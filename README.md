# **A Simple Bubble Generator**

Demo here : https://ogunk.github.io/Simple-Bubble-Generator/

This is just a simple side project for fun.

- 10 bubbles will be generated on the page and you will be able to hover them, which will stop the hovered bubble movement.
- If you click on a blank spot a new bubble will be generated
- If you click on a bubble and the size is not too small it will create 4 new bubble which will take the previous size / 4, if the size of the bubble is too small it will delete the bubble

TODO  :
- On hover stop the bubble and make it draggable for the user
    - Stop is done
    - Make bubbles draggable
